## The 5 Design Phases

### Phase 1: Empathize

**Goal:** Frame the problem as an opportunity

**Task:** Create a "How Might We" (HMW) statement

**Format:**

```
How might we help [specific user]
to [accomplish goal]
so that [benefit/outcome]?
```

**Good Example:**

```
How might we help busy students get quality
coffee quickly so that they can stay alert
in afternoon classes without missing lectures?
```

**Tips:**

- Focus on the user, not the solution
- Be specific about who you're helping
- Include the desired outcome
- Avoid proposing solutions yet

**Scoring:** 20 points for valid HMW statement

---

### Phase 2: Ideate

**Goal:** Generate many diverse ideas quickly

**Task:** Create 5-10 ideas in 3 minutes (or more without timer)

**How it works:**

1. Click "Start Idea Generation"
2. Timer begins (3:00)
3. Type ideas and press Enter
4. Each idea appears as numbered card
5. Continue until timer ends or you have 5+ ideas

**Ideation Prompts:**

- What would [Apple/Google/Tesla] do?
- What if budget was unlimited?
- What if we had only $100?
- What's the opposite approach?
- How would a 5-year-old solve this?
- What if it had to work offline?

**Categories to explore:**

- üîß Technical solutions
- ü§ù Social/behavioral solutions
- üì± Digital solutions
- üè¢ Systemic solutions
- üé® Experience solutions
- üí° Radical alternatives

**Example Ideas:**

```
1. Mobile pre-order app with campus pickup
2. Coffee subscription service for students
3. Express line for between-class rush
4. Coffee vending machines in buildings
5. Peer-to-peer coffee delivery network
6. AI chatbot for menu recommendations
7. Loyalty points for fast pickup
8. Partnership with meal plan system
```

**Tips:**

- Don't self-censor
- Build on previous ideas
- Embrace wild concepts
- Write headlines, not essays
- Go for quantity
- Mix practical with radical

**Scoring:** 5 points per idea

### Phase 4: Prototype

**Goal:** Make your best idea tangible and testable

**Task:** Describe a simple prototype

**What to include:**

1. **One-sentence pitch**
   - "A mobile app that lets students pre-order coffee and skip the line"

2. **Key features (3-5)**
   - Real-time wait time display
   - One-tap reorder favorites
   - Pick-up time estimates
   - Campus location integration
   - Payment through meal plan

3. **User scenario**
   - "Sarah is between classes. She opens the app, sees
     the campus coffee shop has a 10-minute wait. She
     orders her usual latte, selects 'ready in 15 min,'
     and pays with dining dollars. She walks over and
     picks up her order from the mobile shelf. Total
     time: 2 minutes."

4. **First test plan**
   - "In 48 hours, I would: Create paper mockups of the
     app screens, interview 5 students about their coffee
     habits, and have them walk through the ordering flow
     using the paper prototype."

**Prototype Fidelity Levels:**

- üìù Concept description
- üé≠ Storyboard sequence
- üì¶ Physical mockup
- üíª Digital wireframe
- üé¨ Role-play scenario

**Example Prototype:**

```
PROTOTYPE: Coffee Queue App

Pitch: A mobile app that shows real-time wait times
and enables pre-ordering at campus coffee shops.

Key Features:
1. Live wait time dashboard
2. One-tap favorite orders
3. Pick-up time scheduler
4. Meal plan integration
5. Queue position tracking

User Scenario:
Alex has 15 minutes between classes. He checks the
app, sees 8-minute wait at the Union coffee shop.
He pre-orders his regular medium coffee, schedules
pickup for 12 minutes from now, and heads to class.
On his way, he gets a notification that his order
is ready. He walks in, grabs his coffee from the
mobile order shelf, and makes it to class on time.

48-Hour Test:
- Day 1: Create clickable mockup in Figma
- Day 1: Interview 3 baristas about workflow
- Day 2: Test with 5 students using prototype
- Day 2: Observe current ordering behavior
- Measure: Time saved, user satisfaction
```

**Tips:**

- Keep it simple
- Focus on core value
- Make it testable
- Think low-fidelity
- Plan quick validation

**Image Upload (Optional):**

You can now add visual elements to your prototype:

1. Click "Upload Image" button
2. Select image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG)
3. Maximum 3 images, each under 5MB
4. Images appear as thumbnails
5. Remove images with X button
6. Images included in PDF exports

**When to use images:**
- Sketches of interface designs
- Storyboard sequences
- Physical mockup photos
- Wireframe screenshots
- User journey diagrams

**Scoring:** 30 points for detailed prototype

---

### Phase 5: Iterate

**Goal:** Refine based on feedback and reflection

**Task:** Identify improvements and next steps

**Framework: I Like, I Wish, What If**

**I Like... (What's working)**

- Strengths of the concept
- Positive aspects
- Core value proposition
- User benefits

**I Wish... (What needs improvement)**

- Gaps in the solution
- Missing features
- User concerns
- Implementation challenges

**What If... (New possibilities)**

- Variations to explore
- Alternative approaches
- Unexpected uses
- Future enhancements

**Example Iteration:**

```
I LIKE that this solution directly addresses the
time constraint problem students face. The meal
plan integration removes payment friction.

I WISH we had considered how this works during
peak times when 100 students might pre-order at
once. We also need to think about users who don't
have smartphones.

WHAT IF we added a "buddy order" feature where
you can order for friends? What if we gamified it
with rewards for off-peak ordering to distribute
demand? What if coffee shops got a tablet showing
the queue so they could prep better?

SMALLEST TESTABLE VERSION:
Just a Google Form where students can pre-order
one signature drink, with pickup in 15 minutes.
No app needed. Test if pre-ordering alone saves
time.

NEXT VALIDATION STEPS:
1. Survey 50 students: Would you use this?
2. Partner with one coffee shop for pilot
3. Run 1-week test with simple system
4. Measure time saved and satisfaction
```

**Reflection Questions:**

- What surprised us?
- Which idea excites us most?
- What assumptions need testing?
- Who are we leaving out?
- How could this scale?
- What's the minimum viable version?

**Scoring:** 25 points for thorough iteration notes

### Creating Effective HMW Statements

**Good Formula:**

```
How might we help [SPECIFIC USER]
to [ACCOMPLISH GOAL]
so that [BENEFIT/OUTCOME]?
```

**‚úÖ Good Examples:**

```
How might we help new parents track feeding
schedules so that they feel confident their
baby is getting enough nutrition?

How might we help remote workers stay connected
with colleagues so that they feel less isolated
and maintain team relationships?
```

**‚ùå Avoid:**

```
How might we make a better coffee app?
(Too solution-focused)

How might we help people?
(Too vague)

How might we use AI to solve student problems?
(Specifies technology before understanding need)
```

---

### Ideation Best Practices

**Quantity Goals:**

- Minimum: 5 ideas
- Good: 10-15 ideas
- Excellent: 20+ ideas

**Idea Quality:**

- Headlines not essays
- Action-oriented
- Specific enough to visualize
- Diverse in approach

**Avoiding Blocks:**

- Set a timer
- Use prompts
- Build on others
- Switch contexts
- Think extremes

**Prompts to Use:**

- "What would [company] do?"
- "10x bigger/smaller?"
- "Different country/culture?"
- "For a different user?"
- "Opposite solution?"
