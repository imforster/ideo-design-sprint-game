- **Persistence**: Browser localStorage
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last write wins
- **Debouncing**: 300ms for text input
- **Session Lifecycle**: 24-hour automatic cleanup

## What Remains Unchanged

### Original Features (All Implemented)

All 17 original requirements remain fully implemented and documented:
- Solo and Team modes
- 5 IDEO phases (Empathize, Ideate, Select, Prototype, Iterate)
- Custom challenges with topics
- Challenge selection and management
- JSON import/export for challenges
- Image upload for prototypes (up to 3 images)
- PDF export with embedded images
- Email integration
- Customizable timer (30s-30min)
- Score tracking and gamification
- Multiple export formats

### Tasks Document

The tasks.md file was not updated as it only covers the original 17 requirements (tasks 1-10). The collaborative features were implemented separately and are now documented in the requirements and design documents.

## Supporting Documentation

The following documentation files provide additional details about collaborative mode:

- **COLLABORATIVE_FEATURES.md**: Comprehensive feature overview
- **COLLABORATIVE_SETUP.md**: Supabase setup instructions
- **COLLABORATIVE_QUICKSTART.md**: Quick start guide
- **SESSION_CODE_SHARING.md**: Session code sharing details
- **SESSION_PERSISTENCE.md**: Persistence implementation
- **COLLABORATIVE_EDITING.md**: Real-time text editing
- **LEAVE_SESSION_CONFIRMATION.md**: Leave confirmation flow
- **COLLABORATIVE_UI_ELEMENTS.md**: UI component details

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented and Documented

- All 22 requirements (original 17 + new 5)
- Solo mode
- Team mode
- Collaborative mode with full real-time sync
- Session persistence
- All export features (PDF, email, download, clipboard)
- Custom challenges with topics
- Challenge import/export
- Image upload
- Timer customization

### üìù Documentation Complete

- Requirements document updated
- Design document updated

- DOCUMENTATION updated

## Next Steps

The spec is now fully up-to-date with the current implementation. Potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Authentication**: Add Supabase Auth for secure sessions
2. **Session Passwords**: Protect sessions with passwords
3. **Cursor Tracking**: Show where each user is typing
4. **Rich Text**: Add formatting options
5. **Chat**: Built-in team communication
6. **Video Integration**: Embed video conferencing
7. **Session History**: View past sessions
8. **Advanced Permissions**: Fine-grained participant roles

## Conclusion

The IDEO Design Sprint Game has evolved significantly beyond the original spec, with the addition of a comprehensive collaborative mode that enables real-time, distributed design sprints. The requirements and design documents now accurately reflect this implementation, providing a complete reference for the current state of the application.
