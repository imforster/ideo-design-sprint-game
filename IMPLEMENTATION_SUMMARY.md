# Collaborative Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented real-time multi-participant collaboration for the IDEO Design Sprint Game using Supabase as the backend infrastructure.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Infrastructure

**Supabase Integration**
- Added Supabase JavaScript client via CDN
- Configured client initialization with URL and anon key placeholders
- Set up real-time subscription system

**Database Schema**
- Created `sessions` table for session management
- Created `session_data` table for real-time state storage
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Enabled real-time replication
- Added automatic cleanup for old sessions (24 hours)

### 2. State Management

**New State Variables**
```javascript
- sessionId: Unique identifier for collaborative sessions
- isHost: Boolean flag for host privileges
- userName: Participant identification
- joinCode: Input for joining sessions
- participants: Array of connected participants
- isCollaborative: Flag to enable collaborative features
```

**State Synchronization**
- Split state into local vs. shared components
- Implemented `updateSessionData()` for syncing changes
- Added real-time subscription with `useEffect` hook
- Handled conflict resolution for simultaneous updates

### 3. Session Management Functions

**createSession()**
- Generates unique session ID
- Creates database records
- Initializes session with default state
- Sets host privileges

**joinSession(code)**
- Validates session code
- Adds participant to session
- Syncs local state with session data
- Updates participant list

**updateSessionData(updates)**
- Merges updates with current session state
- Writes to Supabase database
- Triggers real-time updates for all participants

**addIdeaToSession(idea)**
- Creates idea object with author attribution
- Adds to shared ideas array
- Syncs with all participants

### 4. Modified Existing Functions

**startGame(mode)**
- Added collaborative mode handling
- Host-only validation for collaborative sessions
- Session data initialization on game start

**handleSubmit()**
- Made async to support database updates
- Added collaborative idea submission
- Syncs HMW statements, prototypes, and iteration notes

**nextPhase()**
- Made async for session updates
- Host-only phase control in collaborative mode
- Syncs phase changes across participants

**toggleIdeaSelection(idea)**
- Made async for collaborative voting
- Syncs selected ideas in real-time

### 5. User Interface Changes

**Mode Selection**
- Changed from 2-column to 3-column grid
- Added "Collaborative" mode option with green theme
- Conditional rendering based on session state

**Session Setup UI**
- Name input for participant identification
- "Create Session" button for hosts
- Session code input and "Join" button for participants
- Participant list display with host indicator
- Session code display for sharing

**Game Controls**
- Updated start button with host-only logic
- "Waiting for host..." message for participants
- Disabled controls for non-hosts where appropriate

**Idea Display**
- Enhanced to show author names in collaborative mode
- Conditional rendering for object vs. string ideas
- Author attribution in small text below ideas

### 6. Real-time Subscription

**Subscription Logic**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Subscribe to session_data changes
  // Filter by current sessionId
  // Update local state on changes
  // Unsubscribe on cleanup
}, [sessionId, isHost, ideas.length, timerDuration]);
```

**Update Handling**
- Selective updates to prevent loops
- Preserves local draft state
- Syncs all shared state components

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Local State Update → updateSessionData() → Supabase
                                                              ↓
Supabase Real-time → Subscription Callback → Local State Update → UI Render
```

### Session Lifecycle

```
1. Host creates session → Session ID generated
2. Participants join → Added to participants array
3. Host starts game → Challenge and initial state set
4. Participants contribute → Ideas synced in real-time
5. Collaborative voting → Selected ideas synced
6. Prototype building → Shared prototype state
7. Session ends → Results available to all
8. Auto-cleanup → Session deleted after 24 hours
```

### State Synchronization

**Shared State (Synced):**
- currentPhase
- challenge
- allIdeas (with authors)
- selectedIdeas
- prototype
- prototypeImages
- hmwStatement
- iterationNotes
- participants
- timerActive
- timer

**Local State (Not Synced):**
- userName (set once)
- isHost (determined at join)
- draftIdea (before submission)
- score (individual)
- UI state (modals, settings)

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

**Public Access**
- No authentication required
- Anyone with session code can join
- All data visible to participants
- Suitable for trusted environments

**Data Protection**
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Supabase encryption at rest
- Automatic session cleanup
- No PII collected beyond names

### Production Recommendations

1. **Enable Authentication**
   - Require Supabase Auth login
   - Link sessions to user accounts
   - Implement proper RLS policies

2. **Add Session Passwords**
   - Hash and store passwords
   - Validate on join
   - Prevent unauthorized access

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limit session creation per IP
   - Prevent spam and abuse
   - Use Supabase Edge Functions

4. **Data Retention**
   - Adjust cleanup period as needed
   - Implement manual deletion
   - Export before cleanup
